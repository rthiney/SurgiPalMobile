                A physician driven cloud-based preference card system and OR platform for surgeries and procedures
            </p>
            <p class='text'> Doctors, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and vendors deserve easy to use tools that facilitate the process of planning, booking and billing for surgeries and procedures. Surgipal was created by a team of physicians to bring surgical
                preference cards into the digital age. Surgipal allows physicians to create, edit and manage their surgery or procedure preference cards online. Doctors and their staff setup, maintain and update their preference cards. Surgeries and procedures
                are scheduled online with preference cards specifically tailored to the patient. Hospitals, ASCs and vendors access these preferences anywhere and anytime for planning and booking purposes. Doctors can bill for surgeries online with the
                simple click of a button. Surgipal keeps a log of all your surgeries and procedures for practice analytics and research purposes. </p>

                <ion-card-content>

                    <p>Raphaël Thiney is a buttoned-up technologist with over 20 year of Web/SaaS experience. A graduate from Hobart with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, he’s been a key-man technologist to 3 start-ups, from the first ever movie/music site where
                        users could not only get the movies they wanted and the music CD’s that were in the movie, too obtaining a commercial mortgage loan online, too figuring out which hedge fund to invest >100M. He was instrumental in raising over
                        3M in capital for his 2nd startup, lead by Charles Ferguson (creator of FrontPage later sold to Microsoft). His skills were then further honed by the arcane NYC Hedge Fund industry working at Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Cerberus
                        Capital. He then lead team of developers both locally and overseas while Head of Technology for a start-up Hedge-Fund Advisory Group in NYC. He moved his family to D.C. in 2012 and began consulting.
                    </p>
                    <p>He focused his efforts in the Healthcare industry where he consulted for the Council for Affordable Quality Heath to streamline the Coordination of Benefits issue facing many payers. Successful, yet bitten by the start-up bug early
                        in his career, his passion for problem solving and technology led him back to the exciting world of the start-up where he feels at home; building teams and solving hard, industry-wide problems. He strives for agile and productive
                        teams that deliver excellence by keeping his hands dirty and close to the metal.
